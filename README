DApps
=====

Exhibiting
----------

Use the version in the build/ (or environments/production/build) directory of
each project.

You should serve them from a (local) web server.

They work with MetaMask:

https://metamask.io/

Or in Mist:

https://github.com/ethereum/mist

Or in a web browser on a machine with a running standalone Ethereum
node:

https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum

Building
--------

You shouldn't need to build and deploy the projects. Use the already built
versions.
